This is an initial implementation of the SSO stuff that is based on the
ideas of the JCIFS SSO implementation.  It was not finished, though
it's pretty close.  The idea was to use the Netlogon service to
do the authentication (as recommended by the MS NTLM documentation), but
the netlogon implementation is stopped because of the trouble
of getting the shared secret (the machine key from the domain controller).

More research is needed to complete the netlogon implementation.

Also, for some reason NTLMV2 messages from the browser would not work
in doing an SMB connection, but the same NTLMV2 messages from the Oakland
HTTP client implementation would work just fine.  This is not understood.

For the moment the SSO work will be abandoned.
