Build instructions for the netlogon.java file.

You need the fixed version of the midlc compiler.  This is checked into the 3rdparty source tree.

Run the compiler in the idl directory (as the working directory) with these options:

-d -v  -Dpackage=com.oaklandsw.http.ntlmsso -s ${workspace_loc:midlc-0.6.1}/symtabjcifs.txt -o ../src/com/oaklandsw/http/ntlmsso/netlogon.idl netlogon.idl

This will generate the netlogon.java file, which should not require any editing or fixup.


The only idl in this directory that's actually used is netlogon.idl, which is had all of the non
essential portions removed from its original source, netlogin.origsamba.idl (this comes from the samba 4.0 sources
in the source/librpc/idl directory.

There is also the microsoft idl file (extracted from the microsoft protocol documents), but this is
for reference purposes only, its structures were definined in a more complex manner
than the samba idl files.

The midlc compiler is very brittle, so if there are changes to the idl, you might have to
fix bugs in the compiler.  If you get "(null)" values emitted into the java, check
the symtabjcifs.txt file to make sure the type trying to be displayed is present
there if it's a primitive type.  Otherwise, make sure the type is defined in the idl.
