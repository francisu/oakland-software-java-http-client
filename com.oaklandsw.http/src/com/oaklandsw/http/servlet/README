This directory contains a servlet with identical functionality
to the JCIFS HTTP authentication filter.

This is based on the JCIFS implementation and the only modification
is to hook that implementation to the Oakland Software authentication
code supporting NTLMv2.

Since this is based on the JCIFS implementation which is LGPL, 
all of the contents of this directory are also licensed as LGPL,
and are thus publicly available (as they are modified code
from the original LGPL code of JCIFS).

The other parts of the Oakland Software HTTP client do not call
or use this code in any way and as such are not dependent on it.
