Source distribution build notes:

See http://www.oaklandsoftware.com/support.html for current known problems.

To build:

1) Apache Ant is required.

2) Unpack the zip file into a directory.  

3) In that directory type "ant".  This will create http.jar.

4) To execute from the source, you must include the following in your classpath:

- Apache Jakarta Commons Logging version 1.1 or higher.
- Apache Jakarta Regular Expressions version 1.3 or higher.

(These libraries are provided in the source distribution zip file)


Note that the http.jar file built from the source is different than that
provided with the runtime version.  The runtime version is obfuscated and
includes code for license checking.  The source version has no license checking.

The runtime version also has the Jakarta regexp and commons logging packaged
in the http.jar file.  When using the source version, you must provide
these libraries in the classpath (as described above).
