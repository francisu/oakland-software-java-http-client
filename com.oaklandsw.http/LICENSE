    Software exlusively according to the terms of the License that
    was purchased:
    
 2a. Runtime License.  This is a per-developer License, meaning
    one License must be purchased for each developer that works
    directly with the Software.  The Runtime License entities Licensee to
    use any number of runtime instances of the software within
    the Licensee company.  Each additional developer requires an 
    additional purchase of a Runtime License.  The Runtime License 
    forbids distribution or use of the software outside of the 
    Licensee company, unless a Redistributable License is purchased.
    
 2b. Redistributable License.  The rights and restrictions of the 
    Runtime License with the additional right that the binary code may 
    be redistributed to others only as an embedded part of a 
    larger product whose functionality is significantly greater 
    than that of the Java HTTP Client.
 	
 2c. Source License.  All of the rights of the Runtime License
    and Redistributable License are included in the Source License.  
    A single Source License is for an unlimited number of developers.
    The Source License entitles Licensee to have access to the 
    source code.  The source code may not be redistributed or disclosed
    outside the Licensee company in any form.

    modify, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract, or otherwise
    reverse engineer Software. Software may not be leased, assigned,
    or sublicensed, in whole or in part. Licensee accepts full
    responsibility for use of the Software including, but not limited
    to, acceptance of full responsibility pursuant to third party
    software and licensing agreements regarding the use of the
    Software to modify, examine, or otherwise process such third party
    software.
 
 4. Trademarks and Logos. This License does not authorize Licensee to
    use any name, trademark or logo of Licensor. Licensee acknowledges
    that Licensor owns the "oakland software" logo. 
    Licensee shall neither take nor permit any action that will
    delete or obscure Licensor's copyright legend on any Software and
    any related documentation and materials.
 
 5. Warranty of Software Title. Licensor warrants that it has the
    right to license the Software it purports to license to Licensee
    and that such Software does not infringe on any patent, copyright
    or other proprietary right of any person. If any person makes 
    any claim against Licensee asserting such infringement, then 
    the Licensor shall, at its sole option, either: (a) defend 
    Licensee all such claims; or (b) obtain for Licensee the right 
    to continue using such Software.  Licensor shall fully indemnify, 
    defend and hold harmless Licensee from and against all such claims, 
    demands, causes of action, judgments, liabilities, damages, costs 
    and expenses including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees.
 
 6. Disclaimer of Warranty. Except as expressly provided in Paragraph
    5 above with respect to title, the Software is provided "AS IS,"
    without any warranty or representation of any kind. ALL EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
    WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
    NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED.
 
 7. Limitation of Liability. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LIABILITY ARISING 
    UNDER SECTION 5 ABOVE, OAKLAND AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE
    LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD PARTY AS
    A RESULT OF USING OR DISTRIBUTING SOFTWARE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
    GENERALITY OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, IN NO EVENT WILL OAKLAND OR
    ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR
    FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
    LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE,
    EVEN IF OAKLAND HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
 
 8. Termination. Licensee may terminate this License at any time by
    destroying all copies of Software. This License will terminate
    immediately without notice from oakland if Licensee fails to comply
    with any provision of this License and does not cure such failure 
    within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of such 
    failure from Licensor.  Upon such termination, Licensee must 
    destroy all copies of Software.
 
 9. Restricted Rights. Use, duplication or disclosure by the United
    States government is subject to the restrictions as set forth in
    the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software Clauses in
    DFARS 252.227-7013(c) (1) (ii) and FAR 52.227-19(c) (2) as
    applicable.
 
 10. Severability. If any of the above provisions are held to be in
     violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any
     jurisdiction, then such provisions are herewith waived to the
     extent necessary for the License to be otherwise enforceable in
     such jurisdiction. However, if in Licensor's opinion deletion of
     any provisions of the License by operation of this paragraph
     unreasonably compromises the rights or increase the liabilities
     of Licensor or its licensors, Licensor reserves the right to
     terminate the License and refund the fee paid by Licensee, if
     any, and such refund shall be Licensee's sole and exclusive
     remedy.
 
 11. No Waiver. No waiver by either party of any breach of any provision
     of this Agreement shall be elective unless in writing signed by
     such party. No waiver shall constitute a continuing waiver unless
     expressly provided in the writing signed by the waiving party.
 
 12. UCC Applicability. To the extent the provisions of this License
     are not inconsistent therewith, this License shall be governed by
     the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in California.
 
 13. Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement
     between the parties respecting the subject matter hereof and
     thereof, and supersedes all previous proposals, negotiations,
     representations, warranties, commitments, writings and
     communications between parties. The terms of this License shall
     prevail notwithstanding any variance with the terms of any
     purchase order or any other document submitted by Licensee.
