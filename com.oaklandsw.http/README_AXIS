Apache Axis/Axis2

The com.oaklandsw.http.external.axis* plugins contain the contents of the source and binary 
distribution for the Axis (Axis2) version unmodified.

This is used for compilation and testing purposes for Axis/Axis2.

To test with different versions, simply point the com.oaklandsw.http plugin
to the desired Axis plugin.

The com.oaklandsw.http.external.axis plugin should always be enabled because
we support only version 1.4 of that.

We support versions 1.2-1.5 of Axis2 and each of those needs to be tested separately.
