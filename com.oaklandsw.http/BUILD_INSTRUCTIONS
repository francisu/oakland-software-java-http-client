Java HTTP client build instructions

Build com.oaklandsw.util first (using it's build.xml).  This is necessary to make sure
the LicenseTool is properly built.

The build creates a license file (http.lic) which is put in the src, and is deleted
from the evaluation (httpEval.jar) jar file.

The http.jar file is obfuscated which is that way for the normal product the the
evaluation version.


Use the file build.xml as the actual build script.  The file build.http.xml goes with the 
source kit.


Build the webprops target before building the website.  This creates the web.properties file.
