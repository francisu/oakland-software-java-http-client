This directory contains the some example programs for the Java HTTP Client.


Executable classes:

HttpRequestSample - Shows how to do a GET or POST request.  Also shows how to use
the HttpUserAgent for authentication.  You can use this to test authentication
on a website.

HttpGetPipeline - Shows how to do pipelining with an HTTP GET.

TestPerf - Used to conduct performance tests comparing the Sun, Oakland, 
and Oakland with pipelining implementations.




Support classes:

SampleUserAgent - Used to provide the authentication credentials.

SamplePipelineCallback - Handles the pipelining processing.




Building the samples:

Change to the examples directory and type "ant".  You must have Apache Ant installed.



Executing the samples:

Run the examples from the examples directory, as they depend on the http.jar file being
in the parent directory.

runsample.sh/bat <program> <args>

For example

runsample.sh HttpRequestSample http://www.google.com

You can do a "-h" to get the args for each example.
