Running the tests:

First, you will need to make sure you have the following servers
running:

Port  Server

80    Apache (this must be configured as a proxy server)
8080  IIS
8081  Tomcat 4.x
8085  Tomcat 3.2
8086  Error Server

8088  NetProxy
8089  Apache (as proxy server)

3128  Squid (Linux - currently berlioz)

The machine to use for the non-squid is set by the nogoop.localhost property, 
which defaults to localhost.

The machine to use for squid is set by nogoop.squidhost property which defaults to berlioz.


Not that the Tomcat 3.2 server is not presently used automatically
unless you either alter a constant in TestEnv or specify the -Dcat
parameter. 

Tomcat 4.x
-Dcat=http://localhost:8081/nogoop

Tomcat 3.2
-Dcat=http://localhost:8085/nogoop


To run the error server:

java com.nogoop.http.server.ErrorServer


To run NetProxy (on Windows):

start -> netproxy -> netproxy configuration.

Ignore errors about evaluation period having expired.

To run squid (on Linux):

Start the squid service


To use different implementations of the HTTP client, specify

-Dsun - sun implementation
-Dinno - innovation.ch implementation
