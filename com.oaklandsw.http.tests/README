Running the tests:

First, you will need to make sure you have the following servers
running:

Port  Server

80    Apache (this must be configured as a proxy server)
8080  IIS
8081  Tomcat 4.x
8085  Tomcat 3.2
8086  Error Server

8088  NetProxy
8089  Apache (as proxy server)

3128  Squid (Linux - currently berlioz)

The machine to use for the non-squid is set by the nogoop.localhost property, 
which defaults to localhost.

The machine to use for squid is set by nogoop.squidhost property which defaults to berlioz.


Not that the Tomcat 3.2 server is not presently used automatically
unless you either alter a constant in TestEnv or specify the -Dcat
parameter. 

Tomcat 4.x
-Dcat=http://localhost:8081/nogoop

Tomcat 3.2
-Dcat=http://localhost:8085/nogoop


To run the error server:

java com.nogoop.http.server.ErrorServer


To run NetProxy (on Windows):

start -> netproxy -> netproxy configuration.

Ignore errors about evaluation period having expired.

To run squid (on Linux):

Start the squid service


To use different implementations of the HTTP client, specify

-Dsun - sun implementation
-Dinno - innovation.ch implementation






Test deployment to the tomcat server.

The com.oaklandsw.http.servlet package in the tests gets built into the oaklandsw.war by the 
http-war ant target.

Put this in the webapp directory of the tomcat installation (typically
on repoman) and restart the cat.  Make sure you delete the oaklandsw directory
before you restart the cat.

The oaklandsw.war file is checked in to make things easier.


Axis

This uses Axis V1.4 (any 1.x after that is fine).  Axis2 is not presently used, even though
it may be installed.

The tests depend on Axis being installed on the webapp (above) Tomcat in the axis
directory.

The com.oaklandsw.http.webservice package contains the web services to be deployed for testing.
None are used right now, testing is done only with the Axis built-in services.

The webservice2 package is setup for Axis2 and is not currently used.
