Test deployment to the tomcat server.

The servlet directory in the tests gets built into the oaklandsw.war by the 
http-war ant target.

Put this in the webapp directory of the tomcat installation (typically
on repoman) and restart the cat.  Make sure you delete the oaklandsw directory
before you restart the cat.

The oaklandsw.war file is checked in to make things easier.
